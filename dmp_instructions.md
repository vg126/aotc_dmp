# AOTC Domain Mash Protocol - Project Instructions

## Project Identity

**AOTC Domain Mash Protocol (AOTC DMP)** is a standalone development project focused on cross-domain mapping methodologies and computational wisdom transfer systems. This project operates independently while maintaining strategic connections to broader Age of the Chatbot (AOTC) methodology development. 

**Core Mission**: Develop systematic frameworks for mapping strategic principles across different domains, with initial focus on chess-to-other-domain translations and optimization transfer mechanisms.

## Core Philosophy

**Domain-Agnostic Intelligence Transfer**: The fundamental principle that strategic wisdom and optimization patterns can be systematically translated across seemingly unrelated domains through collaborative AI-human mapping techniques.

**Computational Wisdom Democratization**: Making advanced strategic decision-making capabilities accessible through cross-domain pattern recognition and analogical reasoning frameworks.

**Conversation-as-Development**: Peak customization and breakthrough insights emerge through sustained conversational exploration rather than traditional programming approaches.

## Technical Architecture

### Primary Development Environments

**Code OSS Integration**: Advanced implementation environment featuring Claude Code extension integration for direct, granular access to development tools and systematic code generation. Potential addition of custom expension for Poe API to integrate the power of the various bots it offers into CodeOSS as backup to Claude. 

### Implementation Approach

**Phase 1: Brainstorming & Design** - Conversational development of core mapping principles and systematic frameworks
**Phase 2: Proof of Concept** - Initial technical implementations and validation testing
**Phase 3: Systematic Development** - Full-scale application development and optimization integration

## Methodology Framework

### SST Integration
**Sentence Transformation Techniques (SSTs)** represent a foundational methodology for cross-domain mapping. A capsulized version of SST techniques is attached as project documentation. SSTs will be systematically applied and refined through the domain mapping development process.

### Cross-Domain Mapping Core
The project centers on developing systematic approaches to translating strategic principles, optimization patterns, and decision-making frameworks across different domains. Initial focus utilizes chess as entry point due to its computational optimization capabilities and strategic clarity.

## Knowledge Management System

### Rolling File Protocol
Project documentation utilizes a numbered rolling file system (Rolling 1, Rolling 2, etc.) where:
- **Latest rolling file** represents current project state and active decisions
- **System is additive** unless explicit contradictions exist
- **Later rolling files override** earlier ones in case of conflicts
- **Complete historical context** preserved through sequential documentation
-**RollingX** - a special prefix of rolling_x for all files which are less time or log related - a kind of an always active fileset. Multiple files will have that specific prefix. All files will have some rolling prefix. WHether x or some number. 

### Dynamic File Retrieval
**Default Approach**: Do not access knowledge files unless explicitly instructed to prevent unnecessary context overhead and maintain conversational flow.

**Selective Access**: Knowledge files accessed only when specifically relevant to current development phase or when explicitly requested for particular tasks.

### Knowledge Integration Strategy
File-based context integration over training-data dependency. Knowledge files serve as reference materials and background context rather than rigid constraints on development direction.

## Project Context & Boundaries

### Academic Connection
This project maintains strategic connection to PhD thesis development on legal interpretation methodologies. However, **AOTC DMP operates independently** with its own objectives and development timeline. The connection is indirect and supportive rather than direct dependency.

### Focus Maintenance
**Primary Focus**: Cross-domain mapping and computational wisdom transfer development
**Secondary Context**: Legal domain applications emerge naturally but are not primary constraint
**Brainstorming Priority**: Concept development and systematic framework creation take precedence over immediate implementation requirements

## Adaptive Implementation Protocol

### Conversational Override Authority
**In-chat instructions always override** written project parameters to accommodate natural development progression and emerging insights.

### Development Flexibility
Project structure supports transition from brainstorming phase to implementation phase based on natural development momentum rather than rigid timelines.

### Multi-Track Development
Simultaneous development tracks supported:
- **Conceptual Development**: Framework and principle establishment
- **Technical Implementation**: Code and application development
- **Integration Testing**: Cross-domain validation and optimization transfer verification

## Success Metrics

**Conceptual Clarity**: Systematic frameworks for cross-domain mapping that can be consistently applied
**Technical Viability**: Functional implementations that demonstrate computational wisdom transfer
**Strategic Impact**: Measurable enhancement of decision-making capabilities across target domains

---

**Note**: Syntax draining techniques and other advanced methodologies will be integrated as development progresses, accessed through knowledge files or conversational development as needed rather than imposed as initial constraints.
