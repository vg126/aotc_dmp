# AOTC Domain Mash Protocol - Session 1 Development Summary

## Core Breakthrough: Granular Mapping Strategy

**Key Insight**: Instead of mapping entire chess games or complex board states, focus on **single piece movement patterns** as the most stripped-down mapping units that maintain strategic coherence.

**Recursive Simplification Protocol**: Permanent question - "Can we strip this down even further?" - to reach the most fundamental mapping units possible before settling on correspondence levels.

## Developed Methodology Framework

### 1. **Movement-Pattern-Essence Extraction**
- **Pawn Movement**: Forward-only progression with single-square commitment
- **Knight Movement**: L-shaped jump that ignores intervening pieces  
- **King Opposition**: Direct confrontation where positioning determines outcome

### 2. **Mappability Evaluation System**
Three-dimensional assessment framework:
- **Correspondence (1-10)**: How many structural elements transfer cleanly
- **Context Integrity (1-10)**: Does strategic purpose remain intact after mapping
- **Behavioral Consistency (1-10)**: Do cause-effect relationships hold true in target domain

### 3. **Victory Condition Requirement**
**Critical Discovery**: Chess elements divorced from victory conditions (like King Opposition without checkmate context) lose strategic meaning and mapping fidelity. All mappings must preserve goal-oriented framework.

## Deterministic Endgame Case Study

**Selected Position**: White King g6, Black King h8, White Pawn e7
- **Black's Constraint**: Only legal move Kg8
- **White's Binary Choice**: Promotion to Queen/Rook (checkmate) vs Knight/Bishop (draw)
- **Mapping Target**: Perfect-information decision with predetermined outcomes

**Computational Correspondence**: This represents **choice-under-complete-information** rather than strategic maneuvering - maps to scenarios with binary outcomes and known consequences.

## Technical Implementation Context

### Platform Strategy
**Primary Goal**: Code OSS integration with Claude extension + Poe extension development
- **Current Status**: Poe API functional in terminal, extension integration in progress
- **Purpose**: Unlimited AI power access, solving Claude Pro limit constraints
- **Timeline**: Background development ongoing

### Cross-Platform Testing
**Immediate Tools**: Gemini Canvas, Grok code editor, GPT Canvas
- **Advantage**: Generous limits, excellent editability, exportability
- **Limitation**: Not permanent solution, context transfer challenges
- **Android Constraint**: No artifact editing capability, brainstorming-only mode

### Artifact Development Approach
**Two-Tier System**:
1. **High-Level Dashboard**: Progress tracking, overview metrics (created)
2. **Granular Analysis Tables**: Specific position mappings, detailed correspondence analysis (next phase)

## Key Distinctions Established

### Mapping Target Precision
**Rejected**: Vague correspondences like "career progression" 
**Required**: Computationally precise targets with identical information-completeness and outcome-determinism

### Correspondence Types
**Linguistic Correspondence**: Surface-level similarity in language/metaphor
**Computational Correspondence**: Structural logic and decision-tree equivalence (our target)

## Immediate Next Steps

1. **Endgame Position Analysis**: Complete mappability assessment of the g6-h8-e7 position
2. **Cross-Platform Testing**: Validate artifact rendering and editing across Gemini Canvas, Grok, GPT Canvas
3. **Methodology Refinement**: Apply recursive simplification to additional chess elements
4. **Code OSS Integration**: Continue background extension development

## Session Continuation Protocol

**Context Anchor**: This summary provides complete context for continuing AOTC Domain Mash Protocol development across any AI platform. Previous conversation history before "granular mapping target" discussion can be safely ignored.

**Primary Focus**: Systematic chess-to-domain mapping through computational correspondence rather than linguistic similarity.

**Success Metrics**: 
- Functional mappability evaluation framework
- 3-5 validated granular chess mappings
- Cross-platform artifact compatibility
- Framework ready for domain expansion testing

---

**Project Status**: Foundation methodology established, ready for systematic mapping development and technical implementation phases.
