# 😶 DMP Integration Log – 2025-07-05

This document captures the critical integration milestones, tool access configurations, resolved blockers, and wishlist items as part of the **Domain Mashing Protocol (DMP)** project, following the latest breakthroughs achieved during a key session on July 5th, 2025.

## • Confirmed Capabilities

### 😀 Strategic Advances

- Full **GitHub integration** with read/write access established via ChatGPT Custom GPT (VGPt) and Claude Code (Code OSS integration).
- Successful **chessboard rendering** in the ChatGPT canvas using HTML/React.
- Verified that **GitHub access via Actions GPT works reliably** when configured with correct schema (based on Gemini-provided template).

#### 📩 Working Agents & Permissions

| Tool / Agent  | Access               | Usage Mode              | Notes                          |
| -- ------------ | --------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| VGPT (4.1)   | ‟Read/Write\u   | Chat + Canvas + GitHub Sync   | Primary conversational + push/pull interface |
| Claude Code | ‟Read/Write      | Code OSS Terminal + Editor   | File sync, commit, and push all functional    |
| Poe Bots   | ‟Write via Extension| Code OSS embedded assistant | Context-limited but useful for rapid scripting |
| Gemini      | „Read Only     | Google Drive + Manual Import  | Output to markdown possible, not auto-pushable  |
| Codex (CLI) | „Rejected        | Failed to handle GitHub output  | Emoji handling + binary misinterpretation issue |

## • Blockers & Frictions

### 😌 Codex Incompatibility

- Codex misinterprets emoji-rich `..txt` as binary
- Multiple failed commit attempts due to formatting assumptions
- Ultimately deemed **unsuitable** for conversational coding or protocol integration

### 😇 Poe Attention Needs Work
- Key-based auth prompt currently blocks smooth execution
- Needs support for API context limits and formatting

#### 😟 Extension Overhall
- All extensions uninstalled to reset workspace
- Rebuilding from lean slate with only core integrations

## • Wishlist & Near-Term Upgrades

### 📗 Ideal Future State

- Seamless push/pull for Poe bots using Claude-like CLI wrapper or script bridge
- Fully markdown-based internal map of all ongoing sub-projects (like SST ‐ Chess ‐ Law)
- Smart bridging from Gemini's Drive outputs to GitHub via VGPT as middleware
- Support for markdown “commits” or annotations across bots with access

### 🔖 Standards

- Integrate dated logs like this under `logs/` or `integration/`
- Match `Rolling” and `RollingX` file naming conventions for compatibility with long-term documentation strategy
- Use `docs/`, `html/`, `notes/` and `canvas/` folders for separating by function

## 🏈 Ready for Push

Once approved, this file should be saved as:

`*integration/2025-07-05_DMP_integration-log.md*`

Then, update the READmE document to reference the `integration/` folder and milestone logs.
